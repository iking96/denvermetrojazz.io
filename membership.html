  <p>
    Denver Metro Jazz is a community jazz band based in Denver, Colorado, launching our inaugural season in 2025. Our mission is to offer non-occupational musicians the opportunity to experience the thrill of playing in a professional-level big band, without the commitments of full-time musicianship.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our weekly rehearsals, held at 2160 S Cook St. in Denver, will be guided by a professional jazz band director who will provide valuable mentorship, education, and musical growth opportunities. The band will hold 6-12 concerts throughout the season performing a diverse and challenging repertoire of big band arrangements.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help cover costs for music, rehearsal space, insurance, and administration, band members will pay monthly dues of $80. In return, you'll have the chance to be part of a musically fulfilling and rewarding experience with like-minded musicians.
